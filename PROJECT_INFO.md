# Project Information: MTA Delay Rideshare Prediction

## Project Title
**Predicting Rideshare Demand Based on NYC Subway Delays**

## Course
IST 707: Applied Machine Learning

## Team Members
Dawryn Rosario, Marko Masnikosa, Rianne Parker

## Summary of Work
This project developed an end-to-end modeling pipeline to predict NYC rideshare demand based on subway delays. Using a variety of publicly available data sources—including MTA delay reports, TLC rideshare records, and NOAA weather data—we constructed a cleaned and merged dataset to train a regression model. 

After exploratory data analysis (EDA), we implemented and fine-tuned an XGBoost regressor to predict rideshare volumes, incorporating temporal, weather, and transportation system features. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining multiple city datasets to support infrastructure planning and transportation policy.

## What I'm Most Proud Of
I am are most proud of successfully integrating and preprocessing three disparate public data sources (TLC, MTA, and NOAA), and applying XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning to produce interpretable, high-performing results. Our model showed clear value in helping predict demand spikes and provided insights into how subway reliability affects rideshare behavior—insights that could be of use to NYC DOT and rideshare companies.
